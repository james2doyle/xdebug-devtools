# Xdebug DevTools

> A Chrome extension for showing your Xdebug errors inside devtools instead of inline in your page.

This extension plucks xdebug errors from the DOM, and places them in a nice panel in the Chrome DevTools. This extension will also parse the HTML output of the xdebug error table and do some nice things like link to documentation and allow you to copy file links to your clipboard.
